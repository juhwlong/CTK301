    <p>It is nighttime in Surrey, we see an owl on the street sign "PRIVET DRIVE" and the camera pans to the street with very identical looking brown bricked houses. The owl flies away and an elderly man with crimson robes and a long silvery white beard named Albus Dumbledore walks out of a forest near the street, past a tabby cat standing next to what looks like a shed. He takes out his deluminator and activates it. Dumbledore zaps all the light out of the lampposts. He puts away the device and a cat meows. Dumbledore looks down at the cat.</p>

  <p> <a href="dan">Dan Flashes</a> The baby has a lightning-bolt shaped scar on his forehead. The camera slowly zooms towards the scar which glows brightly and it immediately flashes, transitioning to a stormy cloud sky. The film's title in metallic gold zooms out around the camera, and lightning flashes to brighten it up. Then, the lightning flashes engulf the screen, transitioning it to the present time.</p>
  <p> <a href="idk">Shops at the Creek</a> Sorry about him. He doesn't understand what it's like, lying there day after day, having people press their ugly faces in on you. [The snake looks up and blinks.] Can you...hear me? [The snake nods] It's just...I've never talked to a snake before. Do you...I mean...do you talk to people often? [The snake shakes its head] You're from Burma, aren't you? Was it nice there, do you miss your family? [The snake turns its head in the direction of a sign which says, Bred in Captivity] I see. That's me as well. I never knew my parents, either.</p>
  <p>Harry leaves the living room area into the hallway and picks up some letters, one of which had his name on it with his address of where he slept. Uncle Vernon and Dudley sit at the table while Aunt Petunia is busy fixing breakfast. Harry walks in with the mail and hands it to Uncle Vernon, then walks to his seat with his letter.
